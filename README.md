21 years old, student in video games, passionate about everything but first of all about pop culture. 🎞

Young ambitious programmer mastering in particular C# and C++, I enjoy developing small games personally or during gamejams. 💻

Dreaming of bringing my stone to this industry, I wish to work in a studio developed by AAA. 🏢

Determined to progress and learn more and more about such a colossal and varied industry. 🏛

Enjoying both the development of tools and the development of gameplay, I know how to be versatile and interested in various fields. 🎮🛠

Due to my status as a student and young developer, I also have a solid foundation in 3D graphics production, in particular mastering tools such as Blender, ZBrush and the Substance suite. 🎨
